# Standing brief for 61GEMSDOE (verbatim, from the task prompt)

Read this at the start of every session on this repository. It is the contract this
project is measured against.

## THE LANE (highest urgency)

MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF SUBMISSION FOR THE COMPETITION. DO NOT COPY A PREVIOUS
SUBMISSION UNLESS IT'S FOR LEARNING AND EDUCATION. BUT WE MUST GENERATE A UNIQUE TIF
SUBMISSION. IT MUST BE OBVIOUS WHETHER IT IS OK TO DOWNLOAD AND SUBMIT THE GENERATED
TIF SUBMISSION.

There should be an easy to download submission tif file as described by the prompt.

**Buried-structure lane: basement-depth steps from gravity inversion.** Alluvial cover
is one reason catalogues miss faults. Parker (1973) and Oldenburg (1974) give the
standard iterative inversion of gravity to basement relief, and Blakely and Jachens
(GSA Bulletin, 1991) applied it to isostatic residual gravity in Nevada to map the
pre-Tertiary surface. Invert the provided isostatic-gravity layer. Use the USGS Basin
and Range basin-depth maps (Saltus and Jachens, GP-1012, 1995) only to calibrate the
density-contrast depth scale, since they are regional (1:2.5M). Map maxima of the
horizontal gradient of basement depth as candidate buried range-front or intrabasin
faults. Gravity resolves such steps only to a few hundred metres at best, so emit
multi-line ribbons rather than thin lines. Report how many withheld basin-interior
segments the steps recover versus random lines. Treat density contrasts within
basement as the competing explanation. Output the standard validated GeoTIFF,
uniqueness-checked against every earlier raster.

## PARALLEL-RUN PROTOCOL

1. **LANE.** Your lane is the single method paragraph above. Stay inside it. If your
   raster's rank-correlation with any registry raster exceeds 0.90, or more than 70% of
   your dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots, you have drifted into
   another lane: log it as a duplicate and stop. Check this on the surface before
   placement AND on the final dots.
2. **REUSE, DON'T REBUILD.** Use the template's cached feature stack,
   `evaluate_holdout.py` and `submission_writer.py`. Holdout = hide-and-recover:
   withhold whole fault segments with a buffer, derive every catalogue-based feature
   only from the visible faults, mask visible faults pixel-exactly, score pooled DTI
   (alpha 0.2, beta 0.8, 300 m triangular kernel). If a shared tool is wrong, fix it
   once in the template and report it; never keep a private fork.
3. **LABEL EVERY NUMBER** as HOLDOUT-DTI (evaluator version, number of withheld
   positives, 95% CI) or ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED (copied from a submission-page receipt).
   A projection is never written as a score.
4. **LEAKAGE CANARY.** Test each feature alone on the holdout before trusting any
   result. AUC above 0.90 means leakage until proven otherwise.
5. **RUN CARD.** End with one JSON card: hypothesis; mechanism; the named non-fault
   process that could mimic it; holdout DTI + CI; correlation/overlap vs registry;
   raster sha256; validator output (no NaN inside the footprint, values in [0,1],
   CRS/shape/transform match); submission name + note of at most 140 characters;
   verdict promote / negative. Negative results are deliverables.
6. **BUDGET.** Stop after 3 experiments or 2 hours. Do not pick submissions: promotion
   to a real slot is a separate selector step, within the weekly cap shown on the
   submission page.

## Standing requirements that apply to every session

- Work line by line verifying from official verified trusted sources; provide links for
  manual review. No manual input; no hallucinations. Flag any irregularities.
- The site must make the download obvious: an easy one-click TIF download in the
  executive summary / at the very beginning of the site, with a clear statement of
  whether it is OK to download and submit.
- Give the submission a unique name and a short note (<= 140 characters) for the
  submission form's Note field.
- Explain exactly how to make a submission into the contest (executive-summary
  subpage).
- Generate 3-5 candidate geological hypotheses not yet tried, naming layers, physical
  signature, why it catches a fault the catalogue lacks, and how it differs from
  anything already implemented; rank by expected DTI improvement and implementation
  cost; validate the top candidate on the spatially-blocked holdout before touching a
  weekly submission slot.
- Put this prompt into the repo README and read it every time we work on the project.
- Core values: **Maximize P(Win)** and **Own the Outcome** - own results end to end,
  treat failure and success as signals, stay accountable for the final outcome.
- Before finishing: run the project's own check over the code you changed, and say what
  you ran and what came back.

## Sandbox limitation (measured, not assumed)

Egress from the development sandbox admits only `github.com`, `api.github.com`,
`codeload.github.com`, `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org` and `files.pythonhosted.org`.
`drivendata.org`, `docs.nlr.gov`, `usgs.gov`, `earthquake.usgs.gov` and
`raw.githubusercontent.com` all fail (SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL / HTTP 000). The competition
rasters are therefore obtained from the hash-pinned GitHub mirror
`buffedlizard55-lab/6GEMSDOE@main:data/bridge/` and every digest is re-verified
locally against the mirror manifest before use.
